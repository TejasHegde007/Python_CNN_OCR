# Convolutional Neural Network

## Overview

A convolutional neural network implemented in pure numpy. It uses a MNIST-like dataset with about 30 alphanumeric symbols. The model is trained on a deep convolutional network using Keras and the weights using python's pickle utility. Only the the forward propagation code is rewritten in pure numpy (as opposed to Theano or Tensorflow as in Keras).


## Dependencies
--------

Dependencies are packaged in the flask folder, so this app does not have any external depencies. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install them. 



## Usage

to start the web app run `python run.py` . To start the notebook run `jupyter notebook` in terminal.
